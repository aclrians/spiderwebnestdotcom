            This website I feel, was a long time coming for me.
            I need a hub to showcase my skills and knowledge about the field that I am in. 
            Also, its a fun side project to relearn how HTML and CSS work. As simple as they appear to be, heading into it with a dust of knowledge makes the experience more memorable. There is a lot of things that I'm planning to do this summer. I have some ML stuff going on, some business things going on, and some math concepts I've been diving into. 
            Can't wait to publish them here :)
